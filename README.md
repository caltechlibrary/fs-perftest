## Introduction

This is a script for running some common test utilities with a trivial parameter scanning approach, to explore values to improve file system performance.

## Installation

Copy the script to the file system volume to be tested.


## Quick start

Edit the top of the script to set the value of `device`.

Run the script as root and save the output somewhere. It will take a few hours to run, so put it in the background too.

```sh
./perftest > ~/output.log 2>&1 &
```


## Usage

After running the script, look through the results.
